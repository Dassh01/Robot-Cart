## This is an (FRC) robot cart I made in Fusion360 with the intent to be more stable, modular, and most importantly, collapsible through pins for the sake of transportability.

The model is around 95% complete, missing only the redudant placements of a few pins. \
(Apologies for the joints in-photo) \

While this model has been peer reviewed, please email me any design reccomendations or modifications. \

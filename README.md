This is a robot cart CAD I made in fusion360, 
in the zip file theres the robot cart master file and all the individual components seperately in the folder "components", you can use it as a reference or anything else!

Be warned, I haven't gotten this peer reviewed so theres probably a quite few flaws with the design, this is mostly an idea
